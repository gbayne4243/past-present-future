  <h2>My Past</h2>

<img class="left" src="images/beck-academy.png" alt="Beck Academy">

  <p>I was born and raised in <a href="http://www.greenvillesc.gov/">Greenville, SC</a>.  My Birthday is on March 16, 2001.  My Best friend
  at the time was a girl named Kate.  I was involved with my church a lot back then because I wasn't as busy but today I still am just not
  as much.  After I went through all of Elementary School I moved on to Beck Academy.  At Beck I took some of the smarter classes
  and those classes benefitted me in the long run because now I'm a lot smarter than I could've been.  </p>
